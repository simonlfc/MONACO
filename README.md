### Customisation

There are several game settings you can customise in `scripts\game\hooks.gsc`.

- `ALWAYS_GHILLIE`
    - Players will always use a Ghillie Suit. Only works when the map and its factions have a ghillie model available, otherwise defaults to regular models.
- `PLUS_10`
    - Classic COD4-style scoring. This does mean that the player/team needs 10x the score to win a game, and server hosters should adjust the score limit accordingly.
- `SKIP_PREMATCH`
    - Enable/disable the prematch timer.
- `STACK_TIMER`
    - Time before the score popup fades out. MW2 default is 1.
